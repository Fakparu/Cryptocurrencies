# Cryptocurrencies
Using unsupervised learning to find information on a Data set

## Project Overview
In this project, a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how it can be grouped to create a classification system is created for the new investment for a Bank that is offering a new cryptocurrency investment to customers. The data used for this project is not an ideal data and it was processed to fit the machine learning models. There is no known output for this data, so unsupervised learning was used and clustering algorithm, used to group the cryptocurrencies.

Deliverables for this project are as follows

1. Preprocessing the Data for PCA

2. Reducing Data Dimensions Using PCA

3. Clustering Cryptocurrencies Using K-means

4. Visualizing Cryptocurrencies Results
